# Quick Motivation
## A Simple Mac App for Self Motivation

Quick Motivation is a simple app that adds a menu bar item with customizable messages. Keeping a message visible helps interrupt distracting thought patterns and refocuses your attention on what matters.

## Support
If you encounter any problems or have suggestions, please file an issue.

## How It Works
If you sometimes get so passionate about a topic that you forget to breathe, you can ping a menu bar item like this:

Alternatively, if you need a reminder to stay focused and get work done, set this as a reminder to yourself:

The app lets you configure and quickly choose between motivational messages.

## Dealing with the Menu Bar
The menu bar on Mac is known for occasionally removing icons. This app does its best to ensure your message will show. If there is not enough space for the full message, it will display just the emoji. However, it's still possible that nothing shows. In that case, you will need to remove other apps from the menu bar and re-launch Quick Motivation.

Even if only the emoji is displayed, you can still hover over the emoji to see the full message and pin it so it remains on the screen, and move it around to where you want it.
